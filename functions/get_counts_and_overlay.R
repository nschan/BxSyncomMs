#' Get counts and overlay
#'
#' @details This function creates two OTU level correlation networks, one for each treatment. 
#' Unless return_corrs is true, these tables are passed to overlay_corrnet. 
#' The treat1 and treat2 strings need to be part of the sample_name of the phyloseq sample_data slot
#' 
#' @param phyl phyloseq object
#' @param treatvar treatment variable, has to be part of sample data
#' @param treat1 first treatment
#' @param treat2 second treatemnt
#' @param OTUcol which taxonomic rank
#' @param mincounts minimum counts required to retain taxon
#' @param mincorr minimum correlation coefficient to retain correlation
#' @param method the correlation coefficient calculated, default is spearman, see corrr:correlate
#' @param use see corrr::correlate, how to deal with missing data?
#' @param return_corrs return correlation table, default: FALSE (passed to overlay_corrent)
