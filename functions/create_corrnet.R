#' Create correlation netowrk
#'
#' @details This function creates a OTU level correlation networks.
#' The treatment string needs to be part of the sample_name of the phyloseq sample_data slot
#' 
#' @param phyl phyloseq object
#' @param treatvar treatment variable, has to be part of sample data
#' @param treatment the treatment of interest
#' @param OTUcol which taxonomic rank
#' @param mincounts minimum counts required to retain taxon, default is 99
#' @param method the correlation coefficient calculated, default is spearman, see corrr::correlate
#' @param use see corrr::correlate, how to deal with missing data?
